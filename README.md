# Zomato_Python_Project

## Restaurant Online and Offline Orders Analysis Project 
### Overview
This project analyzes restaurant data to determine which type of restaurant received more offline orders. This information can be used by Zomato to provide targeted offers to customers based on the type of restaurant that has higher offline order counts.

### Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

 **name:** The name of the restaurant.
 
 **online_order:** Indicates whether the restaurant accepts online orders ('yes' or 'no').
 
**book_table:** Indicates whether the restaurant accepts table bookings ('yes' or 'no').

**rate:** The average rating of the restaurant.

**votes:** The number of votes received by the restaurant.

**approx_cost(for two people):** The approximate cost for two people at the restaurant.

**listed_in(type):** The category or type of the restaurant.
### Objective
The objective of this project is to identify which restaurant type received more offline orders. This insight will help Zomato target customers with offers based on the restaurant types that have a higher number of offline orders.

### Libraries Used
**Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.

**Matplotlib:** For data visualization.

**NumPy:** For numerical operations (optional, depending on data manipulations).

### Results
The bar chart will display the number of offline orders for each restaurant type, helping to identify which types of restaurants are most popular for offline dining.

### Conclusion
By analyzing offline order counts across different restaurant types, Zomato can tailor its marketing efforts to offer promotions and deals to customers based on their dining preferences.
